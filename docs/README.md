SproutCore Documentation
========================

Generating the SproutCore 2.0 documentation requires the sc-docs gem (which can be installed by running `gem install sc-docs`). In order to build the docs, run the generate command from the root SC 2.0 folder:

    ./docs/generate

This will build the documentation in the `docs/output` directory.
